Exercise 6
############

1. Create a report to display the last name, job ID, and hire date for employees with the last names of Matos or Taylor. Order the query in ascending order by hire date.
2. Members of the HR department want to have more flexibility with the queries that you are writing. They would like a report that displays the last name and salary of employees who earn more than an amount that the user specifies after a prompt. 
3. The HR department wants to run reports based on a manager. Create a query that prompts the user for a manager ID, and generates the employee ID, last name, salary, and department for that manager’s employees.
4. Display the last names of all employees who have both an “a” and an “e” in their last name. Order the query in descending by salary
